## Overview

**cheta** is a lightweight Python package that shows **live cricket and football scores** through a **tiny Tkinter GUI** that runs quietly in the background.

It is designed for people who want to stay updated on live matches **without interrupting their primary work** (coding, studying, meetings, etc.).

Cheta launches from the command line and immediately starts tracking live matches, caching scores, and notifying you of important events.

---

## Key Features

- 🖥 **Minimal background GUI**
  - Very small Tkinter window
  - Designed to stay unobtrusive
  - Runs continuously in the background

- ⚡ **Fast startup with caching**
  - On first launch, all live match scores are cached
  - Smooth navigation between matches

- 🔄 **Live updates**
  - Scrapes live cricket and football websites
  - Auto-refresh every **5 minutes**

- 🧭 **Navigable match view**
  - Scroll or switch between live matches
  - View individual match scores in real time

- 🚨 **Smart event notifications**
  - Cricket: sixes, wickets
  - Football: goals
  - Thin, non-intrusive popup bar
  - Auto-dismisses after **10 seconds**
  - Includes a visible loading/progress bar

---

## How Cheta Works

1. **Startup**
   - Cheta is launched via the CLI
   - Live matches are scraped
   - Scores are cached locally

2. **Runtime**
   - Scores refresh every 5 minutes
   - GUI updates automatically
   - Important events are detected

3. **Notifications**
   - A slim horizontal popup appears
   - Displays the event update
   - Progress bar runs for 10 seconds
   - Popup disappears automatically

## Installation

> ⚠️ Cheta is under active development. Installation steps may evolve.

### Local Installation (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cheta.git  
cd cheta  
pip install -e .
```

---

## Getting Started

Start Cheta using the command:

```bash
cheta hello
```

This will:
- Launch the background Tkinter GUI
- Fetch and cache live scores
- Begin monitoring matches automatically

Cheta will continue running until manually stopped.

---

## GUI Behavior

- Runs as a **small, persistent window**
- Can be minimized or left in the background
- Designed to avoid stealing focus
- Lightweight and low-resource

Navigation allows you to:
- Switch between matches
- View updated scores instantly

---

## Notifications

Cheta sends notifications only for **important events**:

### Cricket
- 🏏 Six
- ❌ Wicket

### Football
- ⚽ Goal

**Notification style:**
- Thin horizontal bar
- Appears briefly on screen
- Includes a 10-second loading/progress bar
- Auto-dismisses without user interaction

This ensures updates are visible but never disruptive.

---

## Configuration (Planned)

Future versions will support:

- Custom refresh intervals
- Enable/disable notifications
- Event-type filtering
- Favorite match pinning
- Screen position controls

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Tkinter** – GUI
- **Web scraping** (e.g. requests, BeautifulSoup)
- **Local caching** for performance
- **CLI entry point** (`cheta`)

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Stable CLI interface
- [ ] Robust scraping with fallback sources
- [ ] Configurable notification rules
- [ ] Match favorites
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (Windows / Linux / macOS)
- [ ] PyPI release
- [ ] System tray integration (optional)
